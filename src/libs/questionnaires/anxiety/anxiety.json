It consists of seven questions that relate to the symptoms of GAD.  \n\n**Instruction:** You will be asked to rate how often you have been bothered by each symptom over the past two weeks on a scale from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day).   \n\nAfter completing the questionnaire, you will receive a score and the follow-up that can help you and healthcare professionals determine if you might benefit from further evaluation or treatment for anxiety. \n\nPlease note that this test is not a diagnostic tool. Only a qualified medical professional can diagnose anxiety disorders.  \n\n **Times:** 2 min  \n  **Number of questions:** 7 \n\n**Are you ready to begin the GAD-7 anxiety questionnaire?**",
