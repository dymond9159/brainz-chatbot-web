Each question corresponds to one of the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. \n\n**Instruction**: For each of the nine symptoms listed, you'll indicate how often you've been bothered by the symptom over the past two weeks, using the following scale: 0(Not at all) to 3(Nearly every day)  \n\nAfter completing the questionnaire, you will receive a score and the follow-up that can help you and healthcare professionals determine if you might benefit from further evaluation or treatment for your depression.  \n\nRemeber, the PHQ-9 is a screening tool and not a diagnostic instrument. A high score suggests that a person may have depression, but a full evaluation by a mental health professional is necessary to confirm a diagnosis.  \n\n **Times:** 2 min  \n  **Number of questions:** 9 \n\n**Are you ready to begin the PHQ-9 depression questionnaire?**",
