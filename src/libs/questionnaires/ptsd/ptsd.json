It's often used by mental health professionals to help diagnose PTSD. The PCL-5 consists of 20 items that correspond to the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD.  \n\n**Instruction:** Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (0-4: Not at all to Extremely) for how much the respondent has been bothered by that particular symptom over the past month.  \n\nAfter completing the questionnaire, you will receive a score and the follow-up that can help you and healthcare professionals determine if you might benefit from further evaluation or treatment for your PTSD.  \n\nIf you believe you may have PTSD, it's important to seek help from a qualified mental health professional who can administer the PCL-5 and provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Self-assessment tools can be a helpful starting point, but they are not a substitute for professional evaluation.  \n\n **Times:** 7 min  \n  **Number of questions:** 20 \n\n**Before we begin the PTSD screening using the DSM-5 (PCL-5) questionnaire, are you ready to start the survey?**",
