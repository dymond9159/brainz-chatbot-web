Items on the PCL-5 correspond with DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. The PCL-5 can be used to quantify and monitor symptoms over time, to screen individuals for PTSD, and to assist in making a provisional or temporary diagnosis of PTSD. \n\n  **Introductions** \n\nRead each question carefully, keeping the worst case in mind, and then choose the one option that best represents how much that problem has bothered by that problem in the past month. \n\n (Not at all = 0, A little bit = 1, Moderately = 2, Quite a bit = 3,  \n and Extremely = 4)  \n\n **Times:** 7 min  \n  **Number of questions:** 20 \n\n**Before we begin the PTSD screening using the DSM-5 (PCL-5) questionnaire, are you ready to start the survey?**",
